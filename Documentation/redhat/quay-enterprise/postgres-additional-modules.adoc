Installing Contributor Extensions for Postgres
----------------------------------------------

As of release 2.1.0, Quay Enterprise requires the
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgtrgm.html[pg_trgm]
extension when using PostgreSQL. This extension is part of the
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/contrib.html[Additional
Supplied Modules]. These modules can be installed with standard package
management tools on Debian and Red Hat-based systems.

# apt-get install postgresql-contrib
....

Red Hat/CentOS

The https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/[library/postgres] container
includes the `postgresql-contrib` package.
