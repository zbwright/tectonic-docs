# Developer Guides

Most users will never have to build Container Linux from source or modify it in any way. If you have a need to modify Container Linux, we provide an SDK that allows you to build your own developer images. We also provide OEM functionality for cloud providers and other companies that must customize Container Linux to run within their environment.
