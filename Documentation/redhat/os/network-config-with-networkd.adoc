Network configuration with networkd
-----------------------------------

Container Linux machines are preconfigured with
link:notes-for-distributors.md[networking customized] for each platform.
You can write your own networkd units to replace or override the units
created for each platform. This article covers a subset of networkd
functionality. You can view the
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-networkd.service.html[full
docs here].

Drop a networkd unit in `/etc/systemd/network/` or inject a unit on boot
via a Container Linux Config. Files placed manually on the filesystem
will need to reload networkd afterwards with
`sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd`. Network units injected via a
Container Linux Config will be written to the system before networkd is
started, so there are no work-arounds needed.

Let’s take a look at two common situations: using a static IP and
turning off DHCP.

Static networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure a static IP on `enp2s0`, create `static.network`:

[source,ini]
----
[Match]
Name=enp2s0

[Network]
Address=192.168.0.15/24
Gateway=192.168.0.1
DNS=1.2.3.4
----

Place the file in `/etc/systemd/network/`. To apply the configuration,
run:

[source,sh]
----
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
----

Container Linux Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting up static networking in your Container Linux Config can be done
by writing out the network unit. Be sure to modify the `[Match]` section
with the name of your desired interface, and replace the IPs:

```yaml container-linux-config networkd: units: - name: 00-eth0.network
contents: | [Match] Name=eth0

....
    [Network]
    DNS=1.2.3.4
    Address=10.0.0.101/24
    Gateway=10.0.0.1
....

```

Turn off DHCP on specific interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’d like to use DHCP on all interfaces except `enp2s0`, create two
files. They’ll be checked in lexical order, as described in the
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-networkd.service.html[full
network docs]. Any interfaces matching during earlier files will be
ignored during later files.

10-static.network
+++++++++++++++++

[source,ini]
----
[Match]
Name=enp2s0

[Network]
Address=192.168.0.15/24
Gateway=192.168.0.1
DNS=1.2.3.4
----

Put your settings-of-last-resort in `20-dhcp.network`. For example, any
interfaces matching `en*` that weren’t matched in `10-static.network`
will be configured with DHCP:

20-dhcp.network
+++++++++++++++

[source,ini]
----
[Match]
Name=en*

[Network]
DHCP=yes
----

To apply the configuration, run
`sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd`. Check the status with
`systemctl status systemd-networkd` and read the full log with
`journalctl -u systemd-networkd`.

Turn off IPv6 on specific interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While IPv6 can be disabled globally at boot by appending
`ipv6.disable=1` to the kernel command line, networkd supports disabling
IPv6 on a per-interface basis. When a network unit’s `[Network]` section
has either `LinkLocalAddressing=ipv4` or `LinkLocalAddressing=no`,
networkd will not try to configure IPv6 on the matching interfaces.

Note however that even when using the above option, networkd will still
be expecting to receive router advertisements if IPv6 is not disabled
globally. If IPv6 traffic is not being received by the interface
(e.g. due to `sysctl` or `ip6tables` settings), it will remain in the
`configuring` state and potentially cause timeouts for services waiting
for the network to be fully configured. To avoid this, the
`IPv6AcceptRA=no` option should also be set in the `[Network]` section.

A network unit file’s `[Network]` section should therefore contain the
following to disable IPv6 on its matching interfaces.

[source,ini]
----
[Network]
LinkLocalAddressing=no
IPv6AcceptRA=no
----

Configure static routes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify static routes in a systemd network unit’s `[Route]` section. In
this example, we create a unit file, `10-static.network`, and define in
it a static route to the `172.16.0.0/24` subnet:

10-static.network
+++++++++++++++++

[source,ini]
----
[Route]
Gateway=192.168.122.1
Destination=172.16.0.0/24
----

To specify the same route in a Container Linux Config, create the
systemd network unit there instead:

`yaml container-linux-config networkd:   units:     - name: 10-static.network       contents: |         [Route]         Gateway=192.168.122.1         Destination=172.16.0.0/24`

Configure multiple IP addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure multiple IP addresses on one interface, we define multiple
`Address` keys in the network unit. In the example below, we’ve also
defined a different gateway for each IP address.

20-multi_ip.network
+++++++++++++++++++

[source,ini]
----
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
DNS=8.8.8.8
Address=10.0.0.101/24
Gateway=10.0.0.1
Address=10.0.1.101/24
Gateway=10.0.1.1
----

To do the same thing through a Container Linux Config:

```yaml container-linux-config networkd: units: - name:
20-multi_ip.network contents: | [Match] Name=eth0

....
    [Network]
    DNS=8.8.8.8
    Address=10.0.0.101/24
    Gateway=10.0.0.1
    Address=10.0.1.101/24
    Gateway=10.0.1.1
....

```

Debugging networkd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’ve faced some problems with networkd you can enable debug mode
following the instructions below.

Enable debugging manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source,sh]
----
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/
----

Create link:using-systemd-drop-in-units.md[Drop-In]
`/etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-debug.conf` with
following content:

[source,sh]
----
[Service]
Environment=SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

And restart `systemd-networkd` service:

[source,sh]
----
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart systemd-networkd
journalctl -b -u systemd-networkd
----

Enable debugging through a Container Linux Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define a link:using-systemd-drop-in-units.md[Drop-In] in a
link:provisioning.md[Container Linux Config]:

`yaml container-linux-config systemd:   units:     - name: systemd-networkd.service       dropins:         - name: 10-debug.conf           contents: |             [Service]             Environment=SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug`
