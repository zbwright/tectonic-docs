DNS Configuration
-----------------

By default, DNS resolution on Container Linux is handled through
`/etc/resolv.conf`, which is a symlink to
`/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf`. This file is managed by
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html[systemd-resolved].
Normally, `systemd-resolved` gets DNS IP addresses from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-networkd.service.html[systemd-networkd],
either via DHCP or static configuration. DNS IP addresses can also be
set via `systemd-resolved`â€™s
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/resolved.conf.html[resolved.conf].
See link:network-config-with-networkd.md[Network configuration with
networkd] for more information on `systemd-networkd`.

Using a local DNS cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`systemd-resolved` includes a caching DNS resolver. To use it for DNS
resolution and caching, you must enable it via
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html[nsswitch.conf]
by adding `resolve` to the `hosts` section.

Here is an example link:provisioning.md[Container Linux Config] snippet
to do that:

```yaml container-linux-config storage: files: - path:
/etc/nsswitch.conf filesystem: root mode: 0644 contents: inline: | #
/etc/nsswitch.conf:

....
      passwd:      files usrfiles
      shadow:      files usrfiles
      group:       files usrfiles

      hosts:       files usrfiles resolve dns
      networks:    files usrfiles dns

      services:    files usrfiles
      protocols:   files usrfiles
      rpc:         files usrfiles

      ethers:      files
      netmasks:    files
      netgroup:    files
      bootparams:  files
      automount:   files
      aliases:     files
....

```

Only nss-aware applications can take advantage of the `systemd-resolved`
cache. Notably, this means that statically linked Go programs and
programs running within Docker/rkt will use `/etc/resolv.conf` only, and
will not use the `systemd-resolve` cache.
