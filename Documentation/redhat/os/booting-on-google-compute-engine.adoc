Running CoreOS Container Linux on Google Compute Engine
-------------------------------------------------------

Before proceeding, you will need a GCE account
(https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/?utm_source=coreos&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=partner-free-trial[GCE
free trial]) and https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[install gcloud] on your
machine. In each command below, be sure to insert your project name in
place of `<project-id>`.

After installation, log into your account with `gcloud auth login` and
enter your project ID when prompted.

Container Linux Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Container Linux allows you to configure machine parameters, configure
networking, launch systemd units on startup, and more via Container
Linux Configs. These configs are then transpiled into Ignition configs
and given to booting machines. Head over to the
link:provisioning.md[docs to learn about the supported features].

You can provide a raw Ignition config to Container Linux via the Google
Cloud console’s metadata field `user-data` or via a flag using `gcloud`.

As an example, this config will configure and start etcd:

```yaml container-linux-config:gce etcd: # All options get passed as
command line flags to etcd. # Any information inside curly braces comes
from the machine at boot time.

# multi_region and multi_cloud deployments need to use \{PUBLIC_IPV4}
advertise_client_urls: ``http://\{PRIVATE_IPV4}:2379''
initial_advertise_peer_urls: ``http://\{PRIVATE_IPV4}:2380'' # listen on
both the official ports and the legacy ports # legacy ports can be
omitted if your application doesn’t depend on them listen_client_urls:
``http://0.0.0.0:2379'' listen_peer_urls:
``http://\{PRIVATE_IPV4}:2380'' # generate a new token for each unique
cluster from https://discovery.etcd.io/new?size=3 # specify the initial
size of your cluster with ?size=X discovery:
``https://discovery.etcd.io/'' ```

Choosing a channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Container Linux is designed to be
https://coreos.com/why/#updates[updated automatically] with different
schedules per channel. You can link:update-strategies.md[disable this
feature], although we don’t recommend it. Read the
https://coreos.com/releases[release notes] for specific features and bug
fixes.

Create 3 instances from the image above using our Ignition from
`example.ign`:

Stable Channel

Beta Channel

Alpha Channel

....
<div class="tab-pane" id="alpha-create">
  <p>The Alpha channel closely tracks master and is released frequently. The newest versions of system libraries and utilities will be available for testing. The current version is Container Linux {{site.alpha-channel}}.</p>
  <pre>gcloud compute instances create core1 core2 core3 --image-project coreos-cloud --image-family coreos-alpha --zone us-central1-a --machine-type n1-standard-1 --metadata-from-file user-data=config.ign</pre>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane" id="beta-create">
  <p>The Beta channel consists of promoted Alpha releases. The current version is Container Linux {{site.beta-channel}}.</p>
  <pre>gcloud compute instances create core1 core2 core3 --image-project coreos-cloud --image-family coreos-beta --zone us-central1-a --machine-type n1-standard-1 --metadata-from-file user-data=config.ign</pre>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane active" id="stable-create">
  <p>The Stable channel should be used by production clusters. Versions of Container Linux are battle-tested within the Beta and Alpha channels before being promoted. The current version is Container Linux {{site.stable-channel}}.</p>
  <pre>gcloud compute instances create core1 core2 core3 --image-project coreos-cloud --image-family coreos-stable --zone us-central1-a --machine-type n1-standard-1 --metadata-from-file user-data=config.ign</pre>
</div>
....

Additional storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additional disks attached to instances can be mounted with a `.mount`
unit. Each disk can be accessed via
`/dev/disk/by-id/google-<disk-name>`. Here’s the Container Linux Config
to format and mount a disk called `database-backup`:

```yaml container-linux-config:gce storage: filesystems: - mount:
device: /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Google_PersistentDisk_database-backup
format: ext4

systemd: units: - name: media-backup.mount enable: true contents: |
[Mount] What=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Google_PersistentDisk_database-backup
Where=/media/backup Type=ext4

....
[Install]
    RequiredBy=local-fs.target
....

```

For more information about mounting storage, Google’s
https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#attach_disk[own
documentation] is the best source. You can also read about
link:mounting-storage.md[mounting storage on Container Linux].

Adding more machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add more instances to the cluster, just launch more with the same
Ignition config inside of the project.

SSH
~~~

You can log in your Container Linux instances using:

[source,sh]
----
gcloud compute ssh --zone us-central1-a core@<instance-name>
----

Users other than `core`, which are set up by the GCE account manager,
may not be a member of required groups. If you have issues, try running
commands such as `journalctl` with sudo.

Using CoreOS Container Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have a machine booted it is time to play around. Check out
the link:quickstart.md[Container Linux Quickstart] guide or dig into
https://coreos.com/docs[more specific topics].
