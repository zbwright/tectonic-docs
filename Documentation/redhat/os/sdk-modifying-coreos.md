# CoreOS Container Linux developer SDK guide

These are the instructions for building Container Linux itself. By the end of the guide you will build a developer image that you can run under KVM and have tools for making changes to the code.

Container Linux is an open source project. All of the source for Container Linux is available on [github][github-coreos]. If you find issues with these docs or the code please send a pull request.

Direct questions and suggestions to the [IRC channel][irc] or [mailing list][coreos-dev].

## Getting started

Let's get set up with an SDK chroot and build a bootable image of Container Linux. The SDK chroot has a full toolchain and isolates the build process from quirks and differences between host OSes. The SDK must be run on an x86-64 Linux machine, the distro should not matter (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc).

### Prerequisites

System requirements to get started:

* curl
* git
* bzip2
* gpg
* sudo

You also need a proper git setup:

```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

**NOTE**: Do the git configuration as a normal user and not with sudo.

### Using Cork

The `cork` utility, included in the CoreOS [mantle](https://github.com/coreos/mantle) project, is used to create and work with an SDK chroot.

First, download the cork utility and verify it with the signature:

```sh
curl -L -o cork https://github.com/coreos/mantle/releases/download/v0.8.2/cork-0.8.2-amd64
curl -L -o cork.sig https://github.com/coreos/mantle/releases/download/v0.8.2/cork-0.8.2-amd64.sig
gpg --receive-keys 9CEB8FE6B4F1E9E752F61C82CDDE268EBB729EC7
gpg --verify cork.sig cork
```

The `gpg --verify` command should output something like this:

```
gpg: Signature made Thu 31 Aug 2017 02:47:22 PM PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 9CEB8FE6B4F1E9E752F61C82CDDE268EBB729EC7
gpg: Good signature from "CoreOS Application Signing Key <security@coreos.com>" [unknown]
Primary key fingerprint: 18AD 5014 C99E F7E3 BA5F  6CE9 50BD D3E0 FC8A 365E
     Subkey fingerprint: 9CEB 8FE6 B4F1 E9E7 52F6  1C82 CDDE 268E BB72 9EC7
```

Then proceed with the installation of the cork binary to a location on your path:

```sh
chmod +x cork
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv cork ~/.local/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

You may want to add the `PATH` export to your shell profile (e.g. `.bashrc`).


Next, use the cork utility to create a project directory. This will hold all of your git repos and the SDK chroot. A few gigabytes of space will be necessary.

```sh
mkdir coreos-sdk
cd coreos-sdk
cork create # This will request root permisions via sudo
cork enter  # This will request root permisions via sudo
```

Verify you are in the SDK chroot:

```
$ grep NAME /etc/os-release
NAME="Container Linux by CoreOS"
```
To leave the SDK chroot, simply run `exit`.

To use the SDK chroot in the future, run `cork enter` from the above directory.


### Using QEMU for cross-compiling

The Container Linux initramfs is generated with the `dracut` tool. `Dracut` assumes it is running on the target system, and produces output only for that CPU architecture. In order to create initramfs files for other architectures, `dracut` is executed under QEMU's user mode emulation of the target CPU via the host system's binfmt support.

#### Configuring QEMU for 64 bit ARM binaries

Note that "64 bit ARM" is known by two short forms: `aarch64` (as seen in the configuration file for QEMU), and `arm64` (as seen in how Container Linux and many other distributions refer to the architecture).

The QEMU binary, `/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static` is not expected to be on the host workstation. It will be inside the `arm64-usr` build chroot entered before running `dracut`.

##### Configuring Debian based systems

For Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian based systems installing the following packages will configure the host system such that QEMU will be the runtime for 64 bit ARM binaries:

    sudo apt-get install binfmt-support qemu-user-static

##### Configuring other systemd based systems

The cork utility can setup QEMU binfmt support on systemd based systems:

```sh
cork setup
systemctl restart systemd-binfmt.service
```

This will install the configuration file `/etc/binfmt.d/qemu-aarch64.conf`, which controls how binaries for a given architecture are handled.

### Building an image

After entering the chroot via `cork` for the first time, you should set user `core`'s password:

```sh
./set_shared_user_password.sh
```

This is the password you will use to log into the console of images built and launched with the SDK.

#### Selecting the architecture to build

##### 64 bit AMD: The amd64-usr target

The `--board` option can be set to one of a few known target architectures, or system "boards", to build for a given CPU.

To create a root filesystem for the `amd64-usr` target beneath the directory `/build/amd64-usr/`:

```sh
./setup_board --default --board=amd64-usr
```

##### 64 bit ARM: The arm64-usr target

Similarly, use `arm64-usr` for the cross-compiled ARM target. If switching between different targets in a single SDK, you can add the `--board=` option to the subsequent `build_packages`, `build_image`, and other similar commands to select the given target architecture and path.

```sh
./setup_board --default --board=arm64-usr
```

#### Compile and link system binaries

Build all of the target binary packages:

```sh
./build_packages
```

#### Render the CoreOS Container Linux image

Build an image based on the binary packages built above, including development tools:

```sh
./build_image dev
```

After `build_image` completes, it prints commands for converting the raw bin into a bootable virtual machine. Run the `image_to_vm.sh` command.

### Booting

Once you build an image you can launch it with KVM (instructions will print out after `image_to_vm.sh` runs).

If you encounter errors with KVM, verify that it is supported by your CPU and enabled in the BIOS.

## Making changes

### git and repo

Container Linux is managed by `repo`, a tool built for the Android project that makes managing a large number of git repositories easier. From the repo announcement blog:

> The repo tool uses an XML-based manifest file describing where the upstream
> repositories are, and how to merge them into a single working checkout. repo
> will recurse across all the git subtrees and handle uploads, pulls, and other
> needed items. repo has built-in knowledge of topic branches and makes working
> with them an essential part of the workflow.

(from the [Google Open Source Blog][repo-blog])

You can find the full manual for repo by visiting [android.com - Developing][android-repo-git].

### Updating repo manifests

The repo manifest for Container Linux lives in a git repository in
`.repo/manifests`. If you need to update the manifest edit `default.xml`
in this directory.

`repo` uses a branch called 'default' to track the upstream branch you
specify in `repo init`, this defaults to 'origin/master'. Keep this in
mind when making changes, the origin git repository should not have a
'default' branch.

## Building images

There are separate workflows for building [production images][prodimages] and [development images][devimages].

## Tips and tricks

We've compiled a [list of tips and tricks][sdktips] that can make working with the SDK a bit easier.

## Testing images

[Mantle][mantle] is a collection of utilities used in testing and launching SDK images.
