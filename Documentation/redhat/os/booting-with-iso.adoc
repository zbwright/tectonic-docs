Known limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  UEFI boot is not currently supported. Boot the system in BIOS
compatibility mode.
2.  There is no straightforward way to provide an
link:provisioning.md[Ignition config].
3.  A mininum of 2 GB of RAM is required to boot Container Linux via
ISO.

Install to disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common use-case for this ISO is to install Container Linux to
disk. You can link:installing-to-disk.md[find those instructions here].

No authentication on console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ISO is configured to start a shell on the console without prompting
for a password. This is convenient for installation and troubleshooting,
but use caution.
