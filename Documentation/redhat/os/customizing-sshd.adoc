Customizing the SSH daemon
--------------------------

Container Linux defaults to running an OpenSSH daemon using `systemd`
socket activation – when a client connects to the port configured for
SSH, `sshd` is started on the fly for that client using a `systemd` unit
derived automatically from a template. In some cases you may want to
customize this daemon’s authentication methods or other configuration.
This guide will show you how to do that at boot time using a
link:provisioning.md[Container Linux Config], and after building by
modifying the `systemd` unit file.

As a practical example, when a client fails to connect by not completing
the TCP connection (e.g. because the ``client'' is actually a TCP port
scanner), the MOTD may report failures of `systemd` units (which will be
named by the source IP that failed to connect) next time you log in to
the Container Linux host. These failures are not themselves harmful, but
it is a good general practice to change how SSH listens, either by
changing the IP address `sshd` listens to from the default setting
(which listens on all configured interfaces), changing the default port,
or both.

Customizing sshd with a Container Linux Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example we will disable logins for the `root` user, only allow
login for the `core` user and disable password based authentication. For
more details on what sections can be added to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` see
the http://www.openssh.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config[OpenSSH
manual]. If you’re interested in additional security options, Mozilla
provides a well-commented example of a
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/OpenSSH#Modern_.28OpenSSH_6.7.2B.29[hardened
configuration].

```yaml container-linux-config storage: files: - path:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config filesystem: root mode: 0600 contents: inline: | #
Use most defaults for sshd configuration. UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp UseDNS no

....
      PermitRootLogin no
      AllowUsers core
      AuthenticationMethods publickey
....

```

Changing the sshd port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Container Linux ships with socket-activated SSH daemon by default. The
configuration for this can be found at
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.socket`. We’re going to override some of
the default settings for this in the Container Linux Config provided at
boot:

`yaml container-linux-config systemd:   units:     - name: sshd.socket       dropins:       - name: 10-sshd-port.conf         contents: |           [Socket]           ListenStream=           ListenStream=222`

`sshd` will now listen only on port 222 on all interfaces when the
system is built.

Disabling socket activation for sshd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may be desirable to disable socket-activation for sshd to ensure it
will reliably accept connections even when systemd or dbus aren’t
operating correctly.

To configure sshd on Container Linux without socket activation, a
Container Linux Config file similar to the following may be used:

`yaml container-linux-config systemd:   units:   - name: sshd.service     enable: true   - name: sshd.socket     mask: true`

Note that in this configuration the port will be configured by updating
the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file with the `Port` directive rather than
via `sshd.socket`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read the link:provisioning.md[full Container Linux Config] guide for
more details on working with Container Linux Configs, including setting
user’s ssh keys.

Customizing sshd after first boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since link:provisioning.md[Container Linux Configs] are only applied on
first boot, existing machines will have to be configured in a different
way.

The following sections walk through applying the same changes documented
above on a running machine.

_Note_: To avoid incidentally locking yourself out of the machine, it’s
a good idea to double-check you’re able to directly login to the
machine’s console, if applicable.

Changing the sshd port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sshd.socket unit may be configured via systemd
link:using-systemd-drop-in-units.md[dropins].

To change how sshd listens, update the list of `ListenStream`s in the
`[Socket]` section of the dropin.

_Note_: `ListenStream` is a list of values with each line adding to the
list. An empty value clears the list, which is why `ListenStream=` is
necessary to prevent it from _also_ listening on the default port `22`.

To change just the listened-to port (in this example, port 222), create
a dropin at
`/etc/systemd/system/sshd.socket.d/10-sshd-listen-ports.conf`

....
# /etc/systemd/system/sshd.socket.d/10-sshd-listen-ports.conf
[Socket]
ListenStream=
ListenStream=222
....

To change the listened-to IP address (in this example, 10.20.30.40):

....
# /etc/systemd/system/sshd.socket.d/10-sshd-listen-ports.conf
[Socket]
ListenStream=
ListenStream=10.20.30.40:22
FreeBind=true
....

You can specify both an IP and an alternate port in a single
`ListenStream` line. IPv6 address bindings would be specified using the
format `[2001:db8::7]:22`.

_Note_: While specifying an IP address is optional, you must always
specify the port, even if it is the default SSH port. The `FreeBind`
option is used to allow the socket to be bound on addresses that are not
yet configured on an interface, to avoid issues caused by delays in IP
configuration at boot. (This option is required only if you are
specifying an address.)

Multiple ListenStream lines can be specified, in which case `sshd` will
listen on all the specified sockets:

....
# /etc/systemd/system/sshd.socket.d/10-sshd-listen-ports.conf
[Socket]
ListenStream=
ListenStream=222
ListenStream=10.20.30.40:223
FreeBind=true
....

Activating changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After creating the dropin file, the changes can be activated by doing a
daemon-reload and restarting `sshd.socket`

....
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd.socket
....

We now see that systemd is listening on the new sockets:

....
$ systemctl status sshd.socket
● sshd.socket - OpenSSH Server Socket
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/sshd.socket; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (listening) since Wed 2015-10-14 21:04:31 UTC; 2min 45s ago
   Listen: [::]:222 (Stream)
           10.20.30.40:223 (Stream)
 Accepted: 1; Connected: 0
...
....

And if we attempt to connect to port 22 on our public IP, the connection
is rejected, but port 222 works:

....
$ ssh core@[public IP]
ssh: connect to host [public IP] port 22: Connection refused
$ ssh -p 222 core@[public IP]
Container Linux by CoreOS stable (1353.8.0)
core@machine $
....

Disabling socket-activation for sshd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simply mask the systemd.socket unit:

....
# systemctl mask --now sshd.socket
....

Finally, restart the sshd.service unit:

....
# systemctl restart sshd.service
....
