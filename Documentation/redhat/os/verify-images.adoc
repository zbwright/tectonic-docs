Verify CoreOS Container Linux images with GPG
---------------------------------------------

CoreOS publishes new Container Linux images for each release across a
variety of platforms and hosting providers. Each channel has its own set
of images
(https://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/[stable],
https://beta.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/[beta],
https://alpha.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/[alpha]) that are
posted to our storage site. Along with each image, a signature is
generated from the https://coreos.com/security/image-signing-key[CoreOS
Image Signing Key] and posted.

After downloading your image, you should verify it with `gpg` tool.
First, download the image signing key:

[source,sh]
----
curl -O https://coreos.com/security/image-signing-key/CoreOS_Image_Signing_Key.asc
----

Next, import the public key and verify that the ID matches the website:
https://coreos.com/security/image-signing-key[CoreOS Image Signing Key]

[source,sh]
----
gpg --import --keyid-format LONG CoreOS_Image_Signing_Key.asc
gpg: key 50E0885593D2DCB4: public key "CoreOS Buildbot (Offical Builds) <buildbot@coreos.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   2  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u
----

Now we’re ready to download an image and it’s signature, ending in .sig.
We’re using the QEMU image in this example:

[source,sh]
----
curl -O https://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_qemu_image.img.bz2
curl -O https://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_qemu_image.img.bz2.sig
----

Verify image with `gpg` tool:

[source,sh]
----
gpg --verify coreos_production_qemu_image.img.bz2.sig
gpg: Signature made Tue Jun 23 09:39:04 2015 CEST using RSA key ID E5676EFC
gpg: Good signature from "CoreOS Buildbot (Offical Builds) <buildbot@coreos.com>"
----

The `Good signature` message indicates that the file signature is valid.
Go launch some machines now that we’ve successfully verified that this
Container Linux image isn’t corrupt, that it was authored by CoreOS, and
wasn’t tampered with in transit.
