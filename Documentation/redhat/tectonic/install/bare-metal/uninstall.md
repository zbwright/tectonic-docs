# Uninstall Tectonic from bare metal

To uninstall Tectonic from a bare metal cluster, delete your cluster to delete the Matchbox profiles and matcher groups. Deletion will not modify or power off your machines.

```
$ terraform destroy -var-file=build/${CLUSTER}/terraform.tfvars platforms/metal
```

Then, set cluster nodes to boot from your pre-Tectonic PXE image.

## Reinstall bare metal Tectonic cluster

Tectonic bare metal clusters should be reprovisioned using the latest [Tectonic bare metal][install-bare-metal] documentation. If you've set up your infrastructure as described, skip to step 4, *Tectonic Installer*. Use the Tectonic Installer application, then set your servers to PXE on the next boot and reboot:

```
ipmitool -H node.example.com -U USER -P PASS chassis bootdev pxe
```
