Bare Metal: Troubleshooting Installation
----------------------------------------

Domain name can’t be changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The domain names selected for Tectonic and Controller DNS names during
install cannot be easily changed later. If a cluster’s domain name needs
to change, set up a new cluster with the new domain name and migrate
cluster work to it.
