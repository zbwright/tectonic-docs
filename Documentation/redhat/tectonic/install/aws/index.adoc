AWS: Installation
-----------------

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the link:requirements.md[requirements doc] to see whatâ€™s needed.
The short version:

* a CoreOS account
* an IAM account
* an link:requirements.md#ssh-key[associated SSH key]
* a domain or subdomain with
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/creating-migrating.html[DNS
name service at AWS Route53].
* Tectonic will create a new AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), or you can
select an existing VPC. To use an existing VPC, see the
link:requirements.md#using-an-existing-vpc[existing VPC requirements].

Create a CoreOS account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tectonic Installer requires the License and Pull Secret provided with a
CoreOS account. To obtain this information and up to 10 free nodes,
create a CoreOS account.

1.  Go to https://account.coreos.com/login, and click _Sign Up_.
2.  Check your inbox for a confirmation email. Click through to accept
the terms of the license, activate your account, and be redirected to
the _Account Overview_ page.
3.  Click ``Free for use up to 10 nodes'' under Tectonic. Enter your
contact information, and click _Get License for 10 nodes_.

Once the update has processed, the _Overview_ window will refresh to
include links to download the License and Pull Secret.

Download and run Tectonic Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure a current version of either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
is set as the default browser on the workstation where Installer will
run.

Download the
https://releases.tectonic.com/releases/tectonic_1.8.9-tectonic.1.zip[Tectonic

[source,bash]
----
wget https://releases.tectonic.com/releases/tectonic_1.8.9-tectonic.1.zip
unzip tectonic_1.8.9-tectonic.1.zip
cd tectonic_1.8.9-tectonic.1

Install Tectonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to read the link:requirements.md[installation requirements],
which include a section on link:requirements.md#privileges[privileges
for your AWS credentials], as well as the
link:../../troubleshooting/faq.md[known issues section in the
Troubleshooting guide] before you install.

Installation requires the CoreOS License and Pull Secret described in
link:#create-a-coreos-account[Create a CoreOS account] above. Be certain
to create an account and enable the 10 free nodes before launching
Tectonic Installer.

Follow the on-screen instructions to provision your cluster. This
process should take about 10-15 minutes.

When prompted, click _Download assets_ to save all assets generated
during the Tectonic Installer process. These assets include
configuration files that will allow you to repeat your cluster set up
manually, and the
https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/[terraform.tfstate] file, which is
required to delete your cluster, when desired.

Once complete click _Go to my Tectonic Console_ to launch the Console,
and begin interacting with your cluster.

If you encounter any errors check the
link:../../troubleshooting/faq.md[troubleshooting] documentation.

Use Tectonic Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you are ready to access Tectonic Console, configure `kubectl`, and
deploy your first application to the cluster. A `kubeconfig` with the
appropriate configuration for `kubectl` is available for download in the
Tectonic Console.

For those new to Tectonic and Kubernetes, the
link:../../tutorials/index.md[Tectonic Tutorials] provide walk through
instructions on getting started.
