Defining Tectonic user roles
----------------------------

Tectonic Console allows you to define Roles used to grant access to
system, namespace or cluster-wide resources.

Each Role is composed of a set of rules, which defines the type of
resource and access allowed the Role.

Creating Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From _Administration > Roles_, click _Create Role_ to open a YAML
template, which may be edited to create a new Role.

....
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - '' # empty quotes ('') indicate the core API group
    resources:
      - pods
    verbs:
      - get
      - watch
      - list
....

Once the Role is created, click its _Name_ in the _Roles_ page, then
click _Add Rule_ to open the _Create Access Rule_ page.

From the Create Access Rule page, select:

*Type of Access:* actions that can be taken on Kubernetes resources are
grouped into easy categories. * _Read-only:_ allows users to view, but
not edit the listed resources. * _All:_ allows full access to all
resources, including the ability to edit or delete. * _Custom:_ grants a
user-defined set of access privileges, as selected from the complete
list of actions.

*Allowed Resources:* * _Recommended:_ grants access to the default set
of safe resources, as recommended by Tectonic. * _All Access:_ grants
full access to all resources, including administrative resources. *
_Custom:_ grants access to a user-defined set of resources, as selected
from the _Safe Resources_, _API Resources_, and _API Groups_ listed
below. * _Non-resource URLs:_ grants access to API URLs that do not
correspond to objects.

Default Roles in Tectonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tectonic inherits most of the cluster-wide roles from Kubernetes
upstream. The default cluster-wide roles in Tectonic are:

[width="100%",cols="49%,<51%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Cluster Roles |Permissions
|cluster-admin |Super-user access. When used in a ClusterRoleBinding,
grants full control over every resource in the cluster and in all
namespaces. When used in a RoleBinding, grants full control over every
resource in the rolebindingâ€™s namespace, including the namespace itself.

|admin |Full control over all objects in a namespace. Bind this role
into a namespace to give administrative control to a user or group. It
does not allow write access to resource quota or to the namespace
itself.

|edit |Read/write access to all common objects, either within a
namespace or cluster-wide. Does not allow read/write access to roles or
rolebindings.

|view |Read-only access to most objects. Can be used cluster-wide, or
within a specific namespace. Does not allow viewing roles, rolebindings,
or secrets.

Roles] in the Kubernetes documentation.
