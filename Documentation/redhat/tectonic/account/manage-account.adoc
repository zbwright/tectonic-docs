Change account context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user may be a member of several CoreOS accounts. For example, they may
have a Quay Enterprise license through work and access to a trial
Tectonic cluster through a personal account. In this case, users must
switch account contexts to access each license separately.

To switch contexts, click the email address in the upper right corner of
the page, and select an account to load the _Overview_ page for that
context.
