Scaling an application on Tectonic
----------------------------------

Kubernetes can scale applications either statically, based on an
explicit count of desired replicas, or
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[dynamically,
adding and removing replicas based on application load].

This document outlines static application scaling in Tectonic.

* Scaling an application from 3 replicas up to 5 using `kubectl` and
Tectonic Console.
* Monitoring this change in the Tectonic Console.

This guide continues the previous tutorial, in which an
link:first-app.md[app was installed] on a Tectonic cluster.

Scaling a deployment with Tectonic Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To control application scale in Tectonic Console, first create a new
`cookies` Deployment that defines a number of `replicas`for the
deployment.

1.  Click _Workloads > Deployments_.
2.  Click _Create Deployment_ to open the YAML manifest editor, with a
skeletal manifest file. Delete the example YAML, and paste the the
`cookies` Deployment manifest below into the editor.
3.  Click _Create_ to save and instantiate the `cookies` Deployment.

cookies Deployment manifest:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cookies
  namespace: default
  labels:
    k8s-app: simple
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: simple
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: cookies
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cookies-container
          image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
          readinessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
          livenessProbe:
           initialDelaySeconds: 30
           timeoutSeconds: 1
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
----

Then, use the Console to scale the deployment.

1.  Click _Workloads > Deployments_.
2.  Click the _cookies_ deployment to open its _Overview_ page.
3.  Under _Desired Count_, click the current number of pods to open the
_Modify Desired Count_ dialog.
4.  Enter a new number, and click _Save Desired Count_ to change the
number of healthy pods the deployment will maintain.

Use Tectonic Console to edit the manifest and scale the deployment.

1.  Click _Workloads > Deployments_.
2.  Click the _cookies_ deployment to open its _Overview_ page.
3.  Click the _YAML_ tab to open an editable deployment manifest.

Change the `replicas` count to the desired number of pods in the
deployment. In this example, the `cookies` deployment is scaled from 3
pods to 5.

[source,sh]
----
spec:
  replicas: 5   # bump from 3 to 5
----

Click _Save Changes_ to scale the deployment to the new number of pods.

Monitoring deployment scale in Tectonic Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the _Pods_ tab of a given deployment to track the number of replicas
and their health.

Scaling a deployment with kubectl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, copy the `cookies` Deployment manifest above into a file named
`cookies.yaml`.

If you compare this Deployment with the `simple-deployment` in the
link:first-app.md[first app tutorial], youâ€™ll notice a few additions.
These additional lines set up health checks and rolling update features.

Next, use `kubectl create` to deploy `cookies.yaml`:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl create -f cookies.yaml
deployment "cookies" created
$ kubectl get deployments/cookies
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cookies   3         3         3            3           18s
----

Then, open `cookies.yaml` in a text editor, and change the `replicas`
value to 5:

[source,sh]
----
spec:
  replicas: 5   # bump from 3 to 5
----

Use `kubectl apply` to apply the changes:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl apply -f cookies.yaml
deployment "cookies" configured
$ kubectl get deploy/cookies
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cookies   5         5         5            5           1m
----

Notice the pod count increases from 3 to 5.

Scaling a deployment with the kubectl scale subcommand
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deployments can be also be scaled directly on the `kubectl` command line
with the `scale` subcommand. The following command scales the `cookies`
deployment back down to three replicas.

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl scale deployments/cookies --replicas=3
deployment "cookies" scaled
$ kubectl get deployments/cookies
NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cookies              3         3         3            3           6m
