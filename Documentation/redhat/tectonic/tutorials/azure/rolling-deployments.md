# Versioning and updating an application on Tectonic

Kubernetes uses rolling deployments to update an application between releases. When a Deployment configuration is updated, Tectonic automatically starts to execute a rolling update of the application. If an update fails, the Deployment can fall back to the previous version.

This tutorial helps Tectonic administrators understand how to:
* Create a Service.
* Expose the Service externally through an Ingress resource.
* Deploy a sample "Cookie Shop" application v1.0.
* Update the sample application from v1.0 to v2.0 without app downtime.
* Perform a health check on the sample application.
* Roll back to v1.0.

## Updating an app using Tectonic Console

Use Tectonic Console to update an active application and demonstrate the power of rolling updates.

### Create a Service

If the service created using `simple-service.yaml` and `simple-ingress.yaml` from the [Deploying an application tutorial][first-app] is running, it may be reused for this tutorial, and its deployment updated. If not, create the service before continuing with this tutorial.

To create a service using Tectonic Console:

1. Go to *Routing > Services* and click *Create Service*.
2. Copy and paste the contents of [`simple-service.yaml`][first-app-service-yaml] described in [Deploying an application from YAML][first-yaml] in to the editor, to replace the YAML file displayed.
3. Click *Create* to create the service, and open the *Service Overview* window.

### Add Ingress

Then, create an Ingress to the Service:

1. Go to *Routing > Ingress* and click *Create Ingress*.
2. Copy and paste the contents of [`simple-ingress.yaml`][first-app-ingress-yaml] described in [Deploying an application from YAML][first-yaml] in to the editor, to replace the YAML file displayed.
3. Click *Create* to add the Ingress resource and open the Ingress *Overview* window.

### Deploy v1.0

A rolling update policy usually defines the rate at which updates will occur and health checks to prove an application is functioning.

First, edit the [`simple-deployment.yaml`][first-app-deployment-yaml] file used in [Deploying an application tutorial][first-app] to create a Deployment that more explicitly defines how Kubernetes will run the app.

Editing the Deployment into the form shown below will:

* Set the update model to `RollingUpdate`.
* Add a `readiness` and `liveness` probe to instruct Kubernetes when and how to check that the Pods are alive and well. In this example, the probes check for an HTTP response.
* Specify the `restartPolicy`, `dnsPolicy`, and `TerminationGracePeriod`.

Go to *Workloads > Deployments*, and click *Create Deployment*.

Enter the following YAML into the window and click *Create* to save changes and deploy the application.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: simple-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    k8s-app: simple
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: simple
  revisionHistoryLimit: 2
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: simple
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
          readinessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
          livenessProbe:
           initialDelaySeconds: 30
           timeoutSeconds: 1
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

Load the service address to see the application:

    <img src="img/azure-cookie-v1.png">
  </div>
</div>

### Deploy v2.0

Next, update the app to change the bakery's branding on the site. Build a new container image, `v2.0`, with the updated logo and background color.

To update the app:

* Go to *Workloads > Deployments*, and click the *simple-deployment* created above.
* Click the *YAML* tab.
* Edit the file displayed to change
  `image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0`
to
  `image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v2.0`

The edited file will look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: simple-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    k8s-app: simple
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: simple
  revisionHistoryLimit: 2
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: simple
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v2.0
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
          readinessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
          livenessProbe:
           initialDelaySeconds: 30
           timeoutSeconds: 1
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

Click *Save Changes* to update the app and begin the rolling update.

Click the *Pods* tab to see existing pods and watch the update in progress. Tectonic Console provides live updates as newer pods appear, and the corresponding older pods disappear.

    <img src="img/azure-simple-deploy-updating.png">
    <div class="co-m-screenshot-caption">Pods being created and terminated by Tectonic</div>
  </div>
</div>

Reload the Cookie Shop page as the deployment updates to see the changes:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <img src="img/azure-cookie-v2.png">
  </div>
</div>

### Perform a health check

The deployment specifies a readiness probe and a liveness probe to determine when it is safe to send traffic to each instance of the application.

If the **readiness** probe fails, the rolling update will be halted automatically. Traffic will never be sent to this pod.

If the **liveness** probe fails at any time over the life of the pod, traffic will be shifted away from the pod.

Between these two mechanisms, Tectonic is always informed of the state of the application and can act accordingly.

### Roll back to v1.0

Use the Console to make quick changes to the deployment. Click the *YAML* tab for *simple-deployment* to edit the manifest, and change `v2.0` back to `v1.0` to roll back the change.

After saving the file, the pods will execute a rolling update back to version 1.0.

    <div class="co-m-screenshot-caption">Using the YAML editor to edit the deployment</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Updating an app using kubectl

The same process may be followed using kubectl and the command line.

### Create a service and add ingress using kubectl

```sh
$ kubectl create -f simple-service.yaml
service "simple-service" created
$ kubectl get services -o wide
NAME              CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE    SELECTOR
simple-service    10.3.113.190 <pending>      80:30657/TCP   1d     k8s-app=simple
```

Then, create the ingress on the cluster:
```sh
$ kubectl create -f simple-ingress.yaml
ingress "simple-ingress" created
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME                HOSTS                               ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE
simple-ingress   my-cluster.example.com             80        24s
```

### Deploy v1.0 using kubectl

First, edit the `simple-deployment.yaml` file used in [Deploying an application tutorial][first-app], as described above in [Deploy v1.0](#deploy-v10) with Tectonic Console.

Then, use `kubectl apply` to deploy the app. Kubernetes will manage the migration from the old version to the new version automatically.

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f simple-deployment.yaml
deployment "simple-deployment" configured
```

Load the Service address to see the application:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <img src="img/azure-cookie-v1.png">
  </div>
</div>

### Deploy v2.0 using kubectl

Next, update the app to change the bakery's branding on the site. A new container image, `v2.0`, has been built with the updated logo and background color.

To update the app, first edit the `simple-deployment.yaml`file, as described above, to change
  `image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0`
to
  `image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v2.0`

Then, open the Deployment in Tectonic Console. The Console shows live updates, refreshing as listed pods are created and destroyed by the Deployment. Click the *Pods* tab to see existing pods.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 co-m-screenshot">
    <img src="img/azure-simple-deployment.png">
    <div class="co-m-screenshot-caption">Viewing a Deployment's Pods</div>
  </div>
</div>

Next, switch back to a terminal and apply the change:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f simple-deployment.yaml
deployment "simple-deployment" configured
```

Tectonic Console provides live updates as newer pods appear, and the corresponding older pods disappear.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 co-m-screenshot">
    <img src="img/azure-simple-deploy-updating.png">
    <div class="co-m-screenshot-caption">Pods being created and terminated by Tectonic</div>
  </div>
</div>

Reload the Cookie Shop page as the deployment updates to see changes:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <img src="img/azure-cookie-v2.png">
  </div>
</div>

Once the app is updated, use Tectonic Console to [perform a health check](#perform-a-health-check) and [roll back to v1.0](#roll-back-to-v10), as described above.
