Versioning and updating an application on Tectonic
--------------------------------------------------

Kubernetes uses rolling deployments to update an application between
releases. When a Deployment configuration is updated, Tectonic
automatically starts to execute a rolling update of the application. If
an update fails, the Deployment can fall back to the previous version.

This tutorial helps Tectonic administrators understand how to: * Create
a Service. * Expose the Service externally through an Ingress resource.
* Deploy a sample ``Cookie Shop'' application v1.0. * Update the sample
application from v1.0 to v2.0 without app downtime. * Perform a health
check on the sample application. * Roll back to v1.0.

Updating an app using Tectonic Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Tectonic Console to update an active application and demonstrate the
power of rolling updates.

Create a Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the service created using `simple-service.yaml` and
`simple-ingress.yaml` from the
link:first-app.md#deploy-a-simple-app[Deploying an application tutorial]
is running, it may be reused for this tutorial, and its deployment
updated. If not, create the service before continuing with this
tutorial.

To create a service using Tectonic Console:

1.  Go to _Routing > Services_ and click _Create Service_.
2.  Copy and paste the contents of
link:first-app.md#simple-service[`simple-service.yaml`] described in
link:first-app.md#deploying-an-application-from-yaml[Deploying an
application from YAML] in to the editor, to replace the YAML file
displayed.
3.  Click _Create_ to create the service, and open the _Service
Overview_ window.

Add Ingress
^^^^^^^^^^^

Then, create an Ingress to the Service:

1.  Go to _Routing > Ingress_ and click _Create Ingress_.
2.  Copy and paste the contents of
link:first-app.md#simple-ingress[`simple-ingress.yaml`] described in
link:first-app.md#deploying-an-application-from-yaml[Deploying an
application from YAML] in to the editor, to replace the YAML file
displayed.
3.  Click _Create_ to add the Ingress resource and open the Ingress
_Overview_ window.

Deploy v1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^

A rolling update policy usually defines the rate at which updates will
occur and health checks to prove an application is functioning.

First, edit the
link:first-app.md#simple-deployment[`simple-deployment.yaml`] file used
in link:first-app.md#deploy-a-simple-app[Deploying an application
tutorial] to create a Deployment that more explicitly defines how
Kubernetes will run the app.

Editing the Deployment into the form shown below will:

* Set the update model to `RollingUpdate`.
* Add a `readiness` and `liveness` probe to instruct Kubernetes when and
how to check that the Pods are alive and well. In this example, the
probes check for an HTTP response.
* Specify the `restartPolicy`, `dnsPolicy`, and
`TerminationGracePeriod`.

Go to _Workloads > Deployments_, and click _Create Deployment_.

Enter the following YAML into the window and click _Create_ to save
changes and deploy the application.

Deploy v2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, update the app to change the bakery’s branding on the site. Build
a new container image, `v2.0`, with the updated logo and background
color.

To update the app:

* Go to _Workloads > Deployments_, and click the _simple-deployment_
created above.
* Click the _YAML_ tab.
* Edit the file displayed to change
`image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0` to
`image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v2.0`

The edited file will look like this:

Click _Save Changes_ to update the app and begin the rolling update.

Click the _Pods_ tab to see existing pods and watch the update in
progress. Tectonic Console provides live updates as newer pods appear,
and the corresponding older pods disappear.

Perform a health check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deployment specifies a readiness probe and a liveness probe to
determine when it is safe to send traffic to each instance of the
application.

If the *readiness* probe fails, the rolling update will be halted
automatically. Traffic will never be sent to this pod.

If the *liveness* probe fails at any time over the life of the pod,
traffic will be shifted away from the pod.

Between these two mechanisms, Tectonic is always informed of the state
of the application and can act accordingly.

Roll back to v1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the Console to make quick changes to the deployment. Click the
_YAML_ tab for _simple-deployment_ to edit the manifest, and change
`v2.0` back to `v1.0` to roll back the change.

After saving the file, the pods will execute a rolling update back to
version 1.0.

Updating an app using kubectl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same process may be followed using kubectl and the command line.

Create a service and add ingress using kubectl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl create -f simple-service.yaml
service "simple-service" created
$ kubectl get services -o wide
NAME              CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE    SELECTOR
simple-service    10.3.113.190 <pending>      80:30657/TCP   1d     k8s-app=simple
----

Then, create the ingress on the cluster:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl create -f simple-ingress.yaml
ingress "simple-ingress" created
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME                HOSTS                               ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE
simple-ingress   my-cluster.example.com             80        24s
----

Deploy v1.0 using kubectl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, edit the `simple-deployment.yaml` file used in
link:first-app.md#deploy-a-simple-app[Deploying an application
tutorial], as described above in link:#deploy-v10[Deploy v1.0] with
Tectonic Console.

Then, use `kubectl apply` to deploy the app. Kubernetes will manage the
migration from the old version to the new version automatically.

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl apply -f simple-deployment.yaml
deployment "simple-deployment" configured
----

Load the Service address to see the application:

....
<img src="img/azure-cookie-v1.png">
....

Deploy v2.0 using kubectl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, update the app to change the bakery’s branding on the site. A new
container image, `v2.0`, has been built with the updated logo and
background color.

To update the app, first edit the `simple-deployment.yaml`file, as
described above, to change `image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0` to
`image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v2.0`

Then, open the Deployment in Tectonic Console. The Console shows live
updates, refreshing as listed pods are created and destroyed by the
Deployment. Click the _Pods_ tab to see existing pods.

....
<img src="img/azure-simple-deployment.png">
<div class="co-m-screenshot-caption">Viewing a Deployment's Pods</div>
....

Next, switch back to a terminal and apply the change:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl apply -f simple-deployment.yaml
deployment "simple-deployment" configured
----

Tectonic Console provides live updates as newer pods appear, and the
corresponding older pods disappear.

....
<img src="img/azure-simple-deploy-updating.png">
<div class="co-m-screenshot-caption">Pods being created and terminated by Tectonic</div>
....

Reload the Cookie Shop page as the deployment updates to see changes:

....
<img src="img/azure-cookie-v2.png">
....

Once the app is updated, use Tectonic Console to
link:#perform-a-health-check[perform a health check] and
link:#roll-back-to-v10[roll back to v1.0], as described above.
