Tectonic FAQ
------------

Tectonic release versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version number of a Tectonic release is a string in the format
`W.X.Y-tectonic.z`, where `W.X.Y` stands for the Kubernetes version
included with the release, and `z` is an incrementing number, starting
at 1, for successive Tectonic releases including that Kubernetes
version. When the version number of the included Kubernetes release
changes, the incrementing value `z` resets to 1.

For example, if the Kubernetes version is 1.8.9, the first Tectonic
production release including it is labeled `1.8.9-tectonic.1`. A second
release including the same 1.8.9 version of Kubernetes would be
`1.8.9-tectonic.2`. When the version number of the included Kubernetes
advances to 1.8.10, the associated Tectonic version number would be
`1.8.10-tectonic.1`.

License and pull-secret formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When copying your license and pull-secret from account.coreos.com, be
sure to choose the correct format. The license format should be ``Raw
Format'' and the pull-secret should be in the ``dockercfg'' format.

Can I use my license on multiple clusters?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, a single license can be used on multiple clusters, as long as the
total limits on that license are not exceeded.

What happens when I exceed my license limits?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your cluster is larger than your license allows, the Console will
prompt you to input an updated license. Enter the new license in the
dialog box that is shown. The new license limits will take a few minutes
to take effect, but applications on the cluster will continue to run.

license.

Domain name can’t be changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The domain names selected for Tectonic and Controller DNS names during
install cannot be easily changed later. If a cluster’s domain name must
change, set up a new cluster with the new domain name and migrate
cluster work to it.

Safari browser on OSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tectonic Installer may fail to download `assets.zip` file during the
install due to a known issue in Safari/Webkit. OSX users are advised to
use Firefox or Chrome to use Tectonic Installer on OSX machines.

How can I recover from a Tectonic Identity misconfiguration?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have misconfigured Tectonic Identity, it is possible to be
temporarily locked out of your cluster. To correct the misconfiguration,
use the credentials in the link:../admin/assets-zip.md[assets bundle]
generated during installation to revert or correct your
link:../users/tectonic-identity-config.md[user and RBAC configuration].
