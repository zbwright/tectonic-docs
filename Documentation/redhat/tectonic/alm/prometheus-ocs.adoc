Prometheus Open Cloud Service
-----------------------------

Tectonic’s Prometheus Open Cloud Service provides a one-click, fully
managed, application monitoring and metrics stack for both operations
and applications teams on-top of a Tectonic cluster. Use Prometheus’s
Alertmanager to route, email, page, or message teams when something goes
wrong with an application or the container infrastructure. Prometheus
OCS is:

* *Highly available:* Configure redundancy to ensure important metrics
are never missed in production or save resources in development
environments by running a single instance.
* *Kubernetes Native:* Use native Kubernetes paradigms like Pod label
selectors and automatically track all application containers even as
they are upgraded, destroyed, or rescheduled.
* *High performance:* Containers encourage the creation of more services
and CoreOS has ensured Prometheus can track all of those services while
using minimal resources. (For more information on Prometheus, see the
blog post https://coreos.com/blog/prometheus-2.0-released[Prometheus,
the backbone of container monitoring, hits 2.0].)

Allows you to deploy and manage Prometheus instance into any namespace.

Deploying Prometheus OCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Tectonic Console to enable the Prometheus OCS for selected
namespaces. For more information on enabling the Prometheus OCS and
creating instances, see link:using-ocs.md[Working with Open Cloud
Services].

By default, objects created using the Prometheus OCS will be labeled
`prometheus=k8s`.

Using the Prometheus Open Cloud Service to deploy a Prometheus instance
will create the following Kubernetes objects: * A Prometheus CRD * A
Prometheus Service Monitor * A Prometheus Stateful Set * A Prometheus
Secret

Ingesting metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prometheus Open Cloud Service will not enable Ingress for the cluster.
First configure Ingress to access the Prometheus UI.

Once enabled, go to `https://{your-cluster-dns}/prometheus` to access
Prometheus monitoring for the cluster. Select _Status > Targets_ to
confirm that Prometheus is correctly configured and ingesting metrics.

Using Alertmanager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the built-in Tectonic Alertmanager with the Prometheus OCS.
Alertmanagers should be shared between Prometheus instances.

For Service discovery, the Prometheus Pod must have permission to access
the Kubernetes API in the tectonic-system namespace. Follow the
instructions in
https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/tectonic-prometheus-operator/user-guides/application-monitoring.html[Application
Monitoring] to create a ClusterRoleBinding to bind the available
ClusterRole to an appropriate ServiceAccount. Using Tectonic Console to
create a Prometheus instance will automatically generate the required
ClusterRoleBinding.

For more information, see
https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/exposing-prometheus-and-alertmanager.md[Exposing
Prometheus and Alertmanager] and
https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/alerting.md[Alerting].

Working with Kubernetes Services to monitor your app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prometheus must have sufficient RBAC permissions to access the
Kubernetes cluster.

The app must be instrumented, and expose an HTTP endpoint. Use the
https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/[Client Library]
appropriate to your app to expose metrics through an HTTP endpoint.

Then, configure Prometheus to discover these targets. 1. Create a
Service selecting the Pods of the deployed app. 2. Create a
ServiceMonitor object to select the Service objects to be monitored by
the Prometheus server. Use a label-selector to define the objects to be
monitored. 3. Configure Prometheus to select the ServiceMonitor.

For more information, see
https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/tectonic-prometheus-operator/user-guides/application-monitoring.html[Application
Monitoring].
